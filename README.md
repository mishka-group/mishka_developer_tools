## Low Maintenance Warning: 

> **This library is in low maintenance mode, which means the author is currently only responding to pull requests.**

We tried to deliver a series of our client's [**CMS**](https://github.com/mishka-group/mishka-cms) built on [**Elixir**](https://elixir-lang.org/) at the start of the [**Mishka Group**](https://github.com/mishka-group) project, but we recently archived this open-source project and have yet to make plans to rework and expand it. This system was created using [**Phoenix**](https://www.phoenixframework.org/) and [**Phoenix LiveView**](https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix_live_view/Phoenix.LiveView.html). After a long period, a series of macros and functional modules emerged from this project and our other projects, which we are gradually publishing in this library.

> **NOTICE**: Do not use the master branch; this library is under heavy development. Expect version `0.1.7`, and for using the new features, please wait until a new release is out.

- ### [GuardedStruct](https://github.com/mishka-group/guarded_struct)

  **We recently separated the [GuardedStruct](https://github.com/mishka-group/guarded_struct) macro into a standalone library. Please visit its repository for more information.**

  > The creation of this macro will allow you to build `Structs` that provide you with a number of important options, including the following:
  >
  > 1. Validation
  > 2. Sanitizing
  > 3. Constructor
  > 4. It provides the capacity to operate in a nested style simultaneously.

- ### [PermissionAccess](https://github.com/mishka-group/mishka_developer_tools/blob/master/guidance/permission-access.md)

> Consider the scenario in which you are responsible for maintaining each user's access level in the database related to users.
> **It is unix like way**.
